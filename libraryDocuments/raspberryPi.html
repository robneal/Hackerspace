	<h4>Raspberry Pi</h4>

	<p>
		Start at 
		<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">http://www.raspberrypi.org</a>, for
		downloadable disk (or rather SD card) images of unix installations,
		manuals, and so on.  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/RaspberryPi/"> 
		http://www.engadget.com/tag/RaspberryPi/</a> has lots of cool things done with 'Pis.
	</p>

	<p>
		So far we've installed 'wheezy' and 'archlinux' on Raspberry Pis - of
		the two, 'wheezy' (Debian-based) was the easier to get running -- the
		'archlinux' (arm-v6h) distribution comes without a number of items,
		notably X.  This can be installed via the net (ASK BEFORE HOOKING YOUR
		DEVICES TO THE WALL), using 'pacman', rather than apt-get or yum.<p>
	</p>

	<p>
		More recent images of 'wheezy' include drivers for most wireless
		networking devices available.  There's a "WiFi" icon on the X desktop
		that will allow you to select the SSID you want to talk to and
		generally set up things right.  If you want to use command line
		commands for configuring the wireless device, the magic command is
		"iwconfig", which works a lot like "ifconfig".
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Tired of the weird keyboard?</b> Wheezy, and some other
		distributions, come with 'uk' keyboard defaults, which turn out to be
		different than keyboards over here.  (This is also known as the "Where
		the &!&? is the '|' key?" problem.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Edit <b>/etc/defaults/keyboard</b>, and change the layout thus:<p>
		<b>XKBLAYOUT="us"</b><p>
		Restarting X should now give you a rational keyboard.  For alternative ways
		of doing the same thing, see <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=9136">this article</a>
