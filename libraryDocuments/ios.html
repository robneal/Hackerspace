	<h1>iOS Development with xCode </h1>
	<p>
		The Macbook Pro in the hackerspace has MacOS 10.9.1 on it, plus the 
		<a href="https://developer.apple.com/ipad/sdk/">XCode and IOS SDK's</a>.
		The iPhone in the hackerspace has been upgraded to IOS 7, and has
		been 'jailbroken' to allow development -- though the sdk comes with a
		simulator as a utilty, holding your fantastic, bejeweled, salesworthy,
		wonderous, moneymaking, the-next-version-will-fix-that app on a phone
		is pretty cool.  (Note that the 'phone' part is disabled, so no
		calling Tanzania is not possible.  Well, except with Skype.)
	<p>

	<p>
		The iTunes on the machine has been loaded with podcasts from apple of
		development how-tos and what-the-hecks.  You are invited to peruse
		them and also the documentation mentioned below.  The user on the
		machine, 'ru-ios@cs.rutgers.edu, is a registered apple developer.  If
		you get to a point where the usual 'hackerspace' user is not enough,
		ask a HackerSpace employee to log you in as the 'ru-ios' user.
