		<h3>Meet Mongo, the DCS Aldebaran NAO</h3>
	</center>

	<p>
		The NAO is a highly functional, self-balancing robot with cameras,
		speakers, touch sensors, motion sensors, and ranging sensors to give a
		good testbed for humanoid robot control.  How good?  Here's Mongo
		getting up from the floor.  This might seem to be a 'cooked' demo, but
		the control program is a generic "stand up" program that figures out
		from any position how to reach a standing position.  (If the robot is
		already in that position, it doesn't do anything.)  It is programmable
		via C++, Python, Java, .NET, matlab, or via its "Choreographie" drag
		and drop (where the dragged items can be created by you or modified --
		you get access to the underlying code.)

		The second half of the video is Mongo doing a series of poses that
		emulate a tai-chi exercise (this particular program comes from
		Aldebaran).
